# Montana Elections

Sandbox for building d3 visualizations to display Montana / Gallatin County election data

Structured (currently) as an index.html entrance point that pulls in different map types as self-contained classes from independent files.

## Setup

Geographies:
- Montana Counties --> Key = County name (all caps)
- (TODO) Montana House Districts
- (TODO) Montana Senate Districts (aggregated House Districts)
- (TODO) Gallatin County precincts --> key = 

Filler data: 
- County-level vote tallies
- (TODO) Other geographies


## TODO:
- Refactor data merge out of individual map type classes
- Add aggregate vote count bars (think through bond measures versus 2-way, 3-way races, etc.)
- Brainstorm other diagram types
- Look at cartograms?
